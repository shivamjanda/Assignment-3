## Getting Started

Here are the instructions to build your first `uniform.css`. Please make sure you have the prerequisites installed before continuing on with the installation steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed.

- [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Dart Sass v1.33.0 or higher](https://sass-lang.com/install)

### Install Dart Sass on Mac OS X or Linux

Install Dart Sass with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on Mac OS X or Linux by running the following command.

```sh
brew install sass/sass/sass
```

### Install Dart Sass on Windows

Install Dart Sass with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows by running the following command.

```sh
choco install sass
```

### Load and Compile Uniform

Add Uniform as a Sass module to your `main.scss` project. Follow these steps to load UniformCSS, compile, and watch for changes.

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   # Change directory to where your main sass file lives
   cd my-project/sass/

   # Clone project
   git clone https://github.com/ThinkUniform/uniformcss
   ```
2. Include the Uniform module in your `main.scss`
   ```scss
   // main.scss
   @use "uniform" as *;
   ```
3. Compile your `uniform.css`
   ```sh
   yarn uniform
   ```
4. Alternatively, you can compile and watch for changes
   ```sh
   yarn uniform:watch
   ```
5. Configure Uniform (optional)
   ```scss
   // main.scss
   @use "uniform" as * with (
     $config: (
       important: true,
       comma-compression: true,
       prefix: myProject,
       colors: (
         custom-color-1: red,
         custom-color-2: blue
       ),
       ...
